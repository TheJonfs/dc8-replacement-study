# Abstract

NASA's Airborne Science Program operates a DC-8-72 Flying Laboratory (N817NA) as its premier platform for large-scale atmospheric science campaigns. Manufactured in 1969 and re-engined with CFM56-2-C1 turbofans, the aircraft faces growing age-related challenges including crew shortages, diminishing spare parts, and high operating costs. This study evaluates five candidate replacement aircraft --- the Gulfstream G-V, Boeing P-8 Poseidon, Boeing 767-200ER, Airbus A330-200, and Boeing 777-200LR --- against the DC-8 baseline across three representative airborne science missions: a 5,050 nm engine-out transport, a 4,200 nm vertical atmospheric sampling profile, and an 8-hour low-altitude smoke survey.

Physics-based performance models were constructed from publicly available specifications and calibrated against published range-payload data using a four-parameter optimization (zero-lift drag coefficient, Oswald efficiency factor, TSFC adjustment, and non-cruise fuel overhead fraction). The calibrated models were applied to each mission to determine feasibility, fuel consumption, reserve fuel margins, and cost efficiency measured in dollars per thousand pounds of payload per nautical mile.

The Boeing 767-200ER emerges as the strongest single-aircraft replacement candidate. It is the only aircraft to pass all three missions with high model confidence, offering the best fuel cost efficiency among reliable results ($0.57--$1.32/klb-nm across missions). Its long fuselage accommodates the spatially separated instrument configurations that scientists require, and its conventional wing-body-tail layout is amenable to the structural modifications needed for external sensor mounts and fuselage cutouts. The Boeing P-8 Poseidon is the strongest fleet-based alternative, with competitive cost efficiency on Missions 2 and 3 when operated as a 2--3 aircraft fleet, though it cannot complete the demanding Mission 1 engine-out scenario. Calibration quality varies significantly across the candidate aircraft, and results for the A330-200, 777-200LR, and DC-8 itself carry substantial quantitative uncertainty due to unphysical calibration parameters.
